# LilyVM

These are my personal scripts for making running VMs with QEMU a bit less of a pain, or require quite as much figuring out
how to tune QEMU to get decent security/performance. Basically, you can take advantage of my years of learning how to tame QEMU without libvirt (a piece of broken down garbage software) with a lot less annoyance.

They're written in bash simply because I made the choice to use bash initially. There aren't many other languages
I would consider using for this; rewriting in either lua or python are the only two I'd genuinely consider.
